Some useful commands of sbt and how to install ( As I am using windows as my operating system I will be guiding mostly in it for ubuntu)


For wndows to install sbt use https://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Windows.html and download msi

Certainly! Here's a simple sbt cheatsheet to help you run a Scala project:

### Basic sbt Commands:

1. **Compile the Project:**
   ```bash
   sbt compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   sbt test
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   sbt run
   ```

   This assumes that your project has a `main` class defined in the `src/main/scala` directory. If there are multiple main classes, sbt will prompt you to choose one.

4. **Package the Project (Create JAR):**
   ```bash
   sbt package
   ```

   The JAR file will be created in the `target/scala-<version>/` directory.

5. **Clean the Project:**
   ```bash
   sbt clean
   ```

   This will remove the `target` directory and other build artifacts.

6. **Enter the sbt Interactive Shell:**
   ```bash
   sbt
   ```

   This opens the interactive sbt shell, where you can execute various commands.

### Additional sbt Commands:

7. **Reload Project (Reload Changes in build.sbt):**
   ```bash
   sbt reload
   ```

8. **List Available Tasks:**
   ```bash
   sbt tasks
   ```

   This will display a list of available tasks in your project.

9. **Show Project Settings:**
   ```bash
   sbt show compile:scalacOptions
   ```

   Replace `compile:scalacOptions` with any task key to display its value.

10. **Exit sbt Shell:**
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

   This will exit the sbt interactive shell.

### Common Issues and Fixes:

11. **Force sbt to Use a Specific Scala Version:**
    ```bash
    sbt ++2.13.8 compile
    ```

    Replace `2.13.8` with your desired Scala version.

12. **Run a Specific Test:**
    ```bash
    sbt "testOnly com.example.MyTest"
    ```

    Replace `com.example.MyTest` with the fully qualified name of your test class.

These commands cover the basic tasks you might need when working with an sbt-managed Scala project. Feel free to customize them based on your project's specific structure and requirements.



I have a project where there are more than one main methods what shall I do?

```sbt "runMain <class-name>```
